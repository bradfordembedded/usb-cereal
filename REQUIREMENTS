USB Cereal Requirements
=======================

Introduction
------------
Requirements listed as SHALL must be adhered to and cannot be violated without
first updating this document.

Requirements listed as SHOULD are highly recommended to be followed but may be
violated without first updating this document so long as the specification
document calls out such violations.


Definitions
-----------
host computer -	The computer which connects via USB to the USB Cereal.
target device -	The device which connects its logic level serial port to the USB
		Cereal.
UART signals -	Tx, Rx, RTS, and CTS lines at logic levels (ie: not +/- 12 V).


SHALL Requirements
------------------
1. The interface from the PCB to the target device SHALL use a 6 pin header
   which matches the pinout and functionality of each pin of the "Adafruit FTDI
   Serial TTL-232 USB Cable" (https://www.adafruit.com/products/70) except as
   noted in other requirements.
2. The VCC power pin output from the USB Cereal to the target device SHALL match
   the configured logic level (ie: 3.3 V logic uses 3.3 V VCC power pin).
3. The VCC power pin output and UART signals' voltage level SHALL be adjustable
   by the user to settings of 1.8 V, 3.3 V, and 5 V.  Only one setting SHALL be
   active at any one time.
4. The host computer SHALL connect to the USB Cereal via USB 2.0 cable.
5. There SHALL be at least 3 indicator LEDs which indicate:
	1. Power applied to the USB Cereal
	2. Tx UART line activity
	3. Rx UART line activity
6. The design SHALL be manufacturable by Macrofab.com using their "Standard
   Process" capabilities for both PCB and assembly
   (https://macrofab.com/help/pcb-specifications-assembly-capabilities/).
7. The PCB design SHALL be manufacturable by OSH Park
   (http://docs.oshpark.com/services/).
8. Standard baud rates covering at least the range from 2400 to 921600 SHALL be
   capable of being used.
9. Freely available drivers SHALL exist and be downloadable without payment.


SHOULD Requirements
-------------------
1. Total cost to manufacture one unit (not including shipping or taxes) at
   Macrofab.com SHOULD be less than $25 USD.
2. Drivers SHOULD be open source for all host computer architectures and
   operating systems.
