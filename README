The USB Cereal project design requirements are documented in the REQUIREMENTS
file.

The USB Cereal project design specification is documented in the SPECIFICATION
file.

USB Cereal is designed in the KiCad EDA electronics CAD software running on the
Debian GNU/Linux operating system.  You can obtain a copy of KiCad EDA from
http://kicad.org/ and a copy of Debian from http://www.debian.org/

In order to obtain the schematic parts library and layout footprint files,
please use the git submodule tools built into the git version control system.
In order to use git's submodule tools to obtain the library and footprint
files, follow these exact steps in your terminal emulator from the directory
